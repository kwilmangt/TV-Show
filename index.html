    <h1>The Office</h1>
    <p>The office is my favorite TV show. It is a comedy 
        about people who work at a paper company called Dunder
         Miflin.

I wanted to put my images in the center of the website, 
but I didn't want to use a value. In order to center the image,
you need to use margin: auto; and display: block; in the syle sheet.
